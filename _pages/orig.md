Hi there! I am a PhD student in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford. Check out my cv [here!](https://andrewwilliams3142.github.io/assets/pdf/resume_williams_june22.pdf)

My work focuses on understanding the role of clouds and large-scale circulation in climate change and connecting the results from complex models to basic, physical theory. 

You can find out some more about the projects I've been involved with on my [publications](https://andrewwilliams3142.github.io/publications/) page.
