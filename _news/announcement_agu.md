I attended my first AGU conference (virtually...) - I presented one poster on [my PhD work](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1015938/v1?redirect=/article/rs-1015938), and gave a talk on my extreme precipitation paper [(in revision at GRL)](https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10508387.1).
