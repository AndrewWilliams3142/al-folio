I attended my first AGU conference (virtually...)! While "there", I presented one poster on my PhD work [(now published in Nature Climate Change)](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1015938/v1?redirect=/article/rs-1015938), and gave a talk on my extreme precipitation paper [(now published in GRL)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL096531).
