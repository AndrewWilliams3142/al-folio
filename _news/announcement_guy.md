Our new paper [Examining the Regional Co-Variability of the Atmospheric Water and Energy Imbalances in Different Model Configurationsâ€”Linking Clouds and Circulation](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021MS002951?af=R), was just published in JAMES! 

In it, we introduce a simple framework which links clouds and circulation through water/energy budget constraints.
