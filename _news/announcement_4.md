I contributed to a [new paper in GMD](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/7659/2021/gmd-14-7659-2021.html), led by the inimitable [Duncan Watson-Parris](https://duncanwp.github.io/). We introduce a new, scalable and open framework for performing emulation and calibration of complex climate datasets - `ESEm`!
